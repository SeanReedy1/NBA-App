https://seanreedy1.github.io/NBA-Player-Comparison-App/

This app is geared towards NBA fans who would like to compare how players performed in several statistical categories last season. Users are prompted to search for a player, select them, and then do that again, selecting one or more further players. After that, the user is able to compare players based on points, assists, and rebounds. The app will order the players according to their ranking and display the statistical information. Users can then remove the selected players and start a new comparison.
